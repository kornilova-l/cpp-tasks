# Topological sorting
Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Edges mush satisfy following requirements:
* Antisymmetry
* Transitivity
* Anti-reflexivity

Class TopologicalSorting implements sorting algorithm.
